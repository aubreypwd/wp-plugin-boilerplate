# What is an App?

The `App` class or `app()` function are loaded as a _shell_ around your services and components. It loads services and components automagically and allows you to talk to different parts of your plugin using the `app()` function. 

It also supplies a slew of useful tools that are commonly used throughout most plugins. It's created automatically in the base plugin file, you can see what it does there.
