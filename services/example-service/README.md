# Example Service

This is a small example of what a [service](/services) is and how it uses a component separate from itself.

[/services/example-service/class-example-service.php](/services/example-service/class-example-service.php)

Want to see a better example, check out the [replace-cli](/services/replace-cli) that uses components more deeply. All the `cli*` components [here](/components/) I've used on other projects and I simply pulled them in quickly.
