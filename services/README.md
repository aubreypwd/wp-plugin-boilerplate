# `services/`

Services are essentially features that use `components/` to do things that are separate from [components](/components/README.md).

Services work with a lot of other "components" to do things creating dependencies of those components. Moving a service from one wpkickstart framework to another may require also moving their used components with them.

Build an entire feature out as a "service."
